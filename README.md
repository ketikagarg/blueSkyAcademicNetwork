This repository stores an interactive network file of the academic starter packs.

There are two network files for visualization https://ketikagarg.github.io/blueSkyAcademicNetwork/network2.html and https://ketikagarg.github.io/blueSkyAcademicNetwork/network1.html

It does not cover all the academic starter packs in the interest of easier data handling. There are currently ~1000 packs included.

I will continue updating the network as starter packs grow.

Contact me at kgarg@caltech.edu for more details or if interested in exploring this data together!

Enjoy!
