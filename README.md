This repository stores an interactive network file of the academic starter packs.

It does not cover all the academic starter packs in the interest of easier data handling. There are currently ~1000 packs included.

I will continue updating the network as starter packs grow.

Contact me at kgarg@caltech.edu for more details or if interested in exploring this data together!

Enjoy!
